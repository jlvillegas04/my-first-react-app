# Make It Real - My first React page

This is a solution to the My first React page project of the Make It Real course.

## Overview

The idea was to convert an already existing HTML code to JSX using React as a framework.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the '404 not fount' page normally

## My process

Taking into account what was taught in class, I did a bit of research to have my concepts clear. Then, I used my already existing HTML code and started changing it to JSX syntax. Once I was finished, I pasted my CSS code and checked the result with $npm run dev

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JSX
- React

### What I learned

As an intro to JSX, this project helped me to understand a bit of how we should be writing code in the future, so it will be neatly optimized.
